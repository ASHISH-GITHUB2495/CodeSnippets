This is the Sparse Representation Toolbox in MATLAB version 1.2.

Classifiers:
The classification methods include
NNLS: nnlsClassifier, bootstrapnnlsClassifier
SRC1: src
SRC2: SRC2
MSRC: computeMetaSample and SRC2
MNNLS(Meta-sample based NNLS): computeMetaSample and nnlsClassifier
LRC: lrc

Requirement:
1. The codes are written in MATLAB 7.11(2010b). It may also work in earlier version, for example MATLAB 7.9(2009a).
2. For using SRC1: you have to install L1_magic which is available at http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~justin/l1magic
3. For using SRC2: you have to install l1_ls which is available at http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/l1_ls

Usage:
Please see the file example.m for how to use them.
For more parameter seting, please use command HELP in the command line, for example help nnlsClassifier.
